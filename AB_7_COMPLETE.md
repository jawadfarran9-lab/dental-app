Date: 2025-12-15

Status: Implemented and approved.

Summary:

- Phone interaction is UI-only (tappable) with no backend/auth changes.
- Maintained existing audit logging and navigation guards.
- Theme-aware and consistent with AB-4 palette; hero imagery from AB-5 respected.

Notes:

- Pre-existing minor typing warnings (e.g., FlatList ref) remain out of scope.

Next:
